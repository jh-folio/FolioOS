"""Language-aware tokenization for indexing, clustering, and deduplication.

Folio OS tokenized with ``[A-Za-z0-9가-힣]{2,}`` in four places. That works for
Korean and English and fails two different ways elsewhere, measured on 20 market
headlines per language (Task 0.4):

- **Japanese produces no tokens at all.** 15 of 20 headlines yielded zero, because
  kana and kanji are outside the class. Empty token sets then collapse together,
  so unrelated Japanese items were merging as duplicates — 20 headlines reduced
  to 6 distinct keys.
- **European produces wrong tokens.** 84–100% of non-ASCII words were split or
  truncated at the accent: ``erhält`` → ``['erh', 'lt']``, ``Telefónica`` →
  ``['Telef', 'nica']``, ``troisième`` → ``['troisi', 'me']``.

So the fix differs by script: Europe needs accent folding, Japan needs the CJK
ranges admitted. Korean and English output must not move at all — they are the
existing corpus and the ranking behaviour users already have.
